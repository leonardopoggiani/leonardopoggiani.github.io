		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			This is my personal page where I want to share personal projects carried out during university studies. <br>
			I am a student of computer engineering at the University of Pisa and I am currently attending the last year of the master's degree course. <br>
			I like to inform myself and always learn something new! My main interests are networks and operating systems, my favorite languages are Java and Python, although I have done numerous projects in C ++ and MySQL.
		</p>

		<h2>I'm currently working on..</h2>
		<p>
			Currently I am working on Live migration on Kubernetes as part of my master degree thesis. <br>
			Also I'm devoleping a simple game on Rust using Bevy engine. You can find more on my Github page.
