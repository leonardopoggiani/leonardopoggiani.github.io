=====================

This is my personal page where I want to share personal projects carried out during university studies. 
I am a student of computer engineering at the University of Pisa and I am currently attending the first year of the master's degree course. 
I like to inform myself and always learn something new! My main interests are networks and operating systems, my favorite languages are Java and Python, although I have done numerous projects in C ++ and MySQL.
